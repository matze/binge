# binge â€“ fetch and manage GitHub release binaries

[![CI](https://github.com/matze/binge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matze/binge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`binge` is a command-line application written in Rust that simplifies the
process of fetching, installing, updating, and managing binary release artifacts
directly from GitHub repositories. It is designed to be a convenient tool for
developers and users who rely on tools distributed as pre-built binaries on
GitHub Releases.

Similar in concept to tools like [eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) and
[cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), `binge`
distinguishes itself by:

* Keeping track of installed binaries, allowing for easy updates (unlike `eget`.
* Not being restricted to projects written in Rust (unlike `cargo-binstall`).
* Offering a simple and focused command-line interface.
* Async first and streaming archive extraction for best performance using
  minimal resources.

`binge` works by inspecting the releases of a given GitHub repository,
identifying a suitable binary artifact for your system's architecture,
downloading it, and placing it in a designated installation directory. It
maintains a manifest file to keep track of what has been installed and where.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use this tool at your own risk. It installs binaries from third-party GitHub
> repositories, which could potentially be malicious and harm your system.
> Always ensure you trust the source of the binaries you install.

## Installation

### From release binaries

You can install pre-built binaries from the [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/matze/binge/releases) and in case you have `binge`
already installed use it to track itself:

```bash
binge install matze/binge
```

### From source

You can also run it from source by cloning this repo and calling `cargo run` or
install it via `cargo` with `cargo install --path .`


## Usage

`binge` provides several subcommands to install and manage installed binaries:

### Installing binaries

`binge install` installs one or more binaries from the specified GitHub
repositories. The format for specifying a repository is `<owner>/<repo>`.

```bash
binge install sharkdp/fd BurntSushi/ripgrep
```

This command will find the latest release for `sharkdp/fd` and
`BurntSushi/ripgrep`, download the appropriate binary artifact for your system,
and install it.

In some cases, the downloaded binary might have a different name than desired,
or you might want to avoid naming conflicts. You can specify a custom name for
the installed binary by adding a colon `:` followed by the desired name after
the repository path:

```bash
binge install idursun/jjui:jjui
```

This will download the binary from `idursun/jjui` that contains an
architecture-specific suffix but install it as `jjui` in your installation
directory.

### Uninstalling binaries

`binge uninstall` uninstalls one or more binaries that were previously installed
by `binge`. Specify the binaries using the `<owner>/<repo>` format.

```bash
binge uninstall sharkdp/fd BurntSushi/ripgrep
```

### Looking for updates

`binge update` checks all currently installed binaries for new releases on
GitHub and updates them if a newer version is available.

```bash
binge update
```

### Renaming binaries

`binge rename` renames a binary that was previously installed by `binge`.
Specify the binary and the new name using the `<owner>/<repo>:<custom>` format.

```bash
binge rename idursun/jjui:jjui
```

### Listing installed binaries

`binge list` lists all binaries currently installed by `binge`.

```bash
binge list
```

By default, this command prints the repository and installed version for each binary:

```
sharkdp/fd 8.7.1
BurntSushi/ripgrep 13.0.0
idursun/jjui 0.6.0
```

You can get a list of installed binaries formatted in a way suitable for the
`binge install` command using the `install` format:

```bash
binge list install
```

This will output something like:

```
sharkdp/fd BurntSushi/ripgrep idursun/jjui:jjui
```

This output can be useful for reinstalling the same set of binaries on another
machine or after a system reinstallation.

### Generating completion scripts

`binge completion` generates shell completion scripts for your preferred shell.
Replace `<shell>` with your shell's name (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`,
`powershell`, `elvish`).

```bash
binge completion bash
```

Follow the instructions provided by the output to integrate completion with your
shell.


## Configuration

`binge` can be configured with a `binge.toml` file located in a standard XDG
directory underneath the `binge` name. As of now it may contain a single
`install_path` key pointing to the location where binaries are to be installed.


### GitHub Personal Access Token

By default, `binge`'s interactions with the GitHub API may be subject to rate
limits. To avoid this, it is highly recommended to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable to a GitHub personal access token.

For enhanced security, consider creating a fine-grained token with minimal
necessary permissions (e.g., read access to public repositories).

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

Add this line to your shell's profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) to
make it persistent.

## Platform Support

Currently, `binge` only supports **Linux**.
